<u><b>The Major Pieces</b></u>
</p> At the start of this class we discussed how end users, computers, servers, http, and the internet all fit together. The key takeaway was the concept of the internet,<br>the world largest computer network, and how we through the internet, starting with a request through a browser on our computer, using HTTP, can access<br>information stored on servers all over the world.
</p>

<u><b>The WWW</b></u>

<p> The World Wide Web is a collection of HTML documents. HTML, <em>HyperText Markup Language</em> is the foundation to build everything we access on the WWW. <br>We can find any kind of file (media, text etc.) on the web but HTML is the is building block of the actual webpages. Other file types or links are embedded into<br>
the HTML document (or webpage). Here's an embedded link to a picture found on the WWW, as an example:

<a href="http://www.hdwallpapersimages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Winter-Tiger-Wild-Cat-Images.jpg">Winter Tiger</a></p>

 <u><b> HTML</b></u>
 <p> HTML is made up of text content, markup, references to other docs and links to other pages. Within the HTML document or webpage we have a series of <em>HTML<br> Elements</em> which are components of the document that are usually started and ended with a tag. Examples of tags are &ltb> for <b>bold</b> lettering or &ltem> for <em>emphasized</em><br>
letters. It is important to always add an end tag i.e. &lt/b> or everything that follows the opening tag will be affected.
There are some elements that does not require<br> a closing (or end) tag and these are called <em>void elements.</em> The break &ltbr> tag is an example of a void element</p>
<p>Another important concept is <b>block</b> vs. <b>inline</b> elements. Block elements start and end with a new line, as with &ltp> and &lt/div>. Block elements form a "box" around<br> 
the content of the element. Inline elements are displayed without line breaks. Examples of Inline elements are &lt/b>, &lt/em> and &lt/img><br></p>
<p>Lastly we noted that all whitespace, new lines, tabs and spaces all turn into a single space (regardless of how lengthy) within the HTML document.<br> 
To force line changes we can use the break &ltbr> or paragraph &ltp> tags. </p>

<u><b>Final Thoughts</b></u>
<p><em>Computers are stupid, people are smart. But people (programmers) makes mistakes and computers do not.<br>
Thus the onus is on the programmers to make sure it tells the computers exactly what we need them to do, down to the last detail.<br> 
There can be no errors in the input or the output will corrupted.</em></p>
